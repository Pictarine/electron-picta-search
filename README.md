This project is a fork from [Dext](https://github.com/DextApp/dext) by [Vu Tran](https://github.com/vutran/).

We found that Dext was a good codebase to start from and decided to add new features to it.

## Installation

The assistant can be invoked via the status bar menu or by hitting `option âŒ¥ + space`
